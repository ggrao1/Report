In past few years, massive ammount of data has been getting created and transmitted through diffrent social media platforms.
However, these data need to be securely transmitted, safely stored and must be protected to being accessed by unauthorized users.
One of the way to secure the data from eavesdropping and unautherized access is to encrypt the data or the channel and in some cases both.

Image form a major part of the data that is being transmitted in various social media platforms. Also, videos being transmitted as sequence of images are of huge amount. Hence encrypting of images becomes mor important.

There have been many algorithms like Data Encryption Standard(DES), Advance Encryption Standard(AES) and many more for performing the encryption operations. But the major problem in using these algorithm is that the computational cost will be high since the size of the image data is often  large and a small chunk of space gets removed, resulting in requesting further compression. Nowadays many algorithms are being proposed that uses diffrent permutation only image encryption algorithms that result in increased speed and simple operations.

Information are usually stored in the file format and securing it is dependent on securing file which is done through encryption and decryption techniques . But in case of images the data is stored in form of matrix where each cell represents a pixel values, thereby incresing the filesize. Therefore if encryption is done on compressed image then its size will increase to that of original image. To avoid this "Modern Cryptographic Approch for Image Encryption Scheme" based on JPEG is used, which goals at enhancing the encryption power and also maintaining the efficiency of compression.

In the proposed project BLAKE2 hash algorithm is used for generating the secret encryption key from plain text. Along with this three diffrent encrypting techniques have been used namely alternating new orthogonal transforms transformation, DC coefficient ecryption and AC coeffientsencryption. To obtain the decrypted form of imag same opertions re applied in reverse order.

Protecting the performance of the syatem against the diffrent types of attack is a major task. This lacked in many comprssion-encryption techniques leading to failure of the system. However, the process of generating encryption key from raw image can increase the diffusion property of cryptosystem.

By icreaseing the AC coefficents category without making any change to the format of data of encrypted bitstream data hiding techniques can be generated. By implementing the proposed syatem we can achive greater amount of encryption and compression.
